# Address book

Welcome to awesome address book!

This is a simple JavaEE project. Explore an 
address book - try to create a record, 
update it or delete; you're free 
to sort your record in ascending or
descending order.

To run the project configure a local 
server (e.g. Tomcat), then go to
http://localhost:8080/home.

That's it :)
